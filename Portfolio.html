                Nissan B12 is one of the most successful car series by Nissan. Nissan Sunny B12 is also known as Nissan Trad Sunny.
                In Japan it was marketed as the TRAD Sunny...TRAD being the wierd Japanese-cool abbreviation for TRADITIONAL.
                The tradition of the Sunny was to be a mid-sized family sedan that offered best in class features and comfort that
                was on the edge of contemporary technology. If you look at B210/211, B310 Sunny you will realise that they are much more engaging,
                had far better technical advances and features than that of its competitiors such as the Corolla and the Lancer.  However, with
                the B11 series Sunny, the tradition of Sunny was felt to be lost. It was small, did not look beautiful, felt cheap. In fact it felt
                more like an entry level sedan and people drew similarities with the Datsun Cherry. With the B12 Sunny Nissan wanted to go back to
                the old tradition of the sunny...so they started a PR campaign titles TRAD Sunny.
